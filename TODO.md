### TODO for the `aitrader` project:

- [ ] **Commenting**
  - Translate all comments in the codebase to English.
  - Ensure clarity and consistency in comments across all files.

- [ ] **External Documentation**
  - Write comprehensive external documentation, including:
    - Project overview and purpose.
    - Setup and installation instructions.
    - Usage examples and workflows.
    - API references, if any.

- [ ] **SOLID Principles Review**
  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensure that each class has one responsibility and that responsibility is entirely encapsulated by the class.
  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Ensure that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) are open for extension but closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Ensure that objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Ensure that no client should be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
